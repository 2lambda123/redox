## Style Guidelines

### Rust

Since **Rust** is a relatively small and new language compared to others like _C_, there's really only one standard. Just follow the official Rust standards for formatting, and maybe run `rustfmt` on your changes, until we setup the CI system to do it automatically.

### Git

Please follow [how to create a proper pull request](https://doc.redox-os.org/book/ch12-04-creating-proper-pull-requests.html).

## Other Ways to Contribute

If you're not big on coding, but you still want to help keep the project going, you can still contribute/support in a variety of ways! We'll try to find a way to use anything you have to offer. 

### Design

If you're a good designer, whether it's _2D graphics, 3D graphics, interfaces, web design, you can help. We need logos, UI design, UI skins, app icons, desktop backgrounds, etc_. More information to come on this in the future, for now just join the [Chat](https://doc.redox-os.org/book/ch13-01-chat.html) and ask about graphic design.
